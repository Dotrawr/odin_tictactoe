# The Odin Project
## Tic Tac Toe

This repo contains my implementation of the Tic Tac Toe project as described in The Odin Project.

The documentation says to: 

  ```Build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.```

This part of the The odin project has introduced Object Oriented Programming and the Ruby style guide.
